A First Shot at Deep Learning with PyTorch
In this notebook, we are going to take a baby step into the world of deep learning using PyTorch. There are a ton of notebooks out there that teach you the fundamentals of deep learning and PyTorch, so here the idea is to give you some basic introduction to deep learning and PyTorch at a very high level. Therefore, this notebook is targeting beginners but it can also serve as a review for more experienced developers.

After completion of this notebook, you are expected to know the basic components of training a basic neural network with PyTorch. I have also left a couple of exercises towards the end with the intention of encouraging more research and practise of your deep learning skills.
